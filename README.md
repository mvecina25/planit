**I have implemented a Page Factory Design Pattern. Page Factory is an inbuilt Page Object Model concept for Selenium WebDriver but it is very optimized.**

**This framework also supports:**
- Reusable methods
- Log4j for logging
- Reporting
- TestNG
- Maven
- Event listener
- Screenshot and highlight the element when test fails

**How to Run:**
- **Go to Help > Eclipse Marketplace. Search for TestNG then install.**
- **Right-click execPlanIT.xml**
- **Run As 'TestNG Suite'**
